# My-passion-project

The success of a project is often more dependent on the interest and passion of the people involved, rather than their skills.  If you are not motivated by your own passion then you leave yourself vulnerable to be controlled by others using fear.  Fear is probably the most powerful motivator but unsustainable and often unhealthy.  In this project you will be given great freedom to define a project that you would truly be  passionate about, while demonstrating your learnings from this course.  For example, you could combine music, art, literature, sports, food, or any other topics with software, algorithms, instructions, etc. Before you begin this project the instructor will demonstrate some creative ways people have used computer science to express their ideas and interests, such as Sonic Pi, Rockstar, Shakespeare, Chef, Scratch, etc.
