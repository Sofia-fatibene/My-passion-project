# My-passion-project

The success of a project is often more dependent on the interest and passion of the people involved, rather than their skills.  If you are not motivated by your own passion then you leave yourself vulnerable to be controlled by others using fear.  Fear is probably the most powerful motivator but unsustainable and often unhealthy.  In this project you will be given great freedom to define a project that you would truly be  passionate about, while demonstrating your learnings from this course.  For example, you could combine music, art, literature, sports, food, or any other topics with software, algorithms, instructions, etc. Before you begin this project the instructor will demonstrate some creative ways people have used computer science to express their ideas and interests, such as Sonic Pi, Rockstar, Shakespeare, Chef, Scratch, etc.

## **The music Researcher**
This program focuses on the use of classes and some specific methods (for example the evaluation of words.) It helps search songs who are insert in the database and recognises them. The music reasercher wuold list you the name of the authour and the name of the song. 
In the future I wuold like to create my own database and upload all of the songs and the possibility of playing them.
