1. **The Music Reasercher** 
This program would have all of the songs. If you write the first word of the song you the program would search all of the songs that start with that word. 
It wuold also tell you the authour\ band of the song. 
It could have a GAME MODE to play with your friends, a sort of riff-off.

 Cons:    
> I don't know how to ask the program to remeber All of the songs. Without having to write them before |

In the future 
> You will be able to play the songs 
> You wuold be able to play onine with your friends 



2. **Horse Chess**
The pawns are all horses, every pawn moves with dressage moves except the knight that jumps. You wold have to write the dressage move or the name of the jump 
in the box to move your pawn. 

Cons:
> The animation of the pawn's moves and the desing of personal character and how to upload them in the code.
