1. **The Music Reasercher** 
This program wuold have all of the Songs. If you wrote the first word of the song you the program would search all of the songs that start with that word. 
It wuold also tell you the authour\ band of the song. 
It could have a GAME MODE to play with your friends, a sort of riff-off.

| Cons    |
|-------- |
|- I don't know how to ask the program to remeber All of the songs. Without having to write them before |

|In the future |
|------------- |
|> You will be able to play the songs |
|> You wuold be able to play onine with your friends |
